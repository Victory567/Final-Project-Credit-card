# Final-Project-Credit-card
Credit scoring is a widely used risk management technique in the financial sector. It makes use of personal information and data provided by credit card applicants to estimate future bankruptcies and credit card loans. The bank has the authority to determine whether or not to provide the applicant a credit card. Credit scores can estimate the level of risk objectively.

A machine learning model is required to predict if an application is a 'good' or 'bad' user in this dataset. However, there is no definition of 'good' or 'bad'. Additionally, the unbalanced data problem is a significant issue in this project.
